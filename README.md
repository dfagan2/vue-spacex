# Vue SpaceX Experiment

This is my first venture into Vue JS in order to learn and evaluate the framework. I used the Vue CLI un-ejected and incorporated some shiny new things that have been on my bucket list to play with (Date FNS, Fetch, etc) and worked to make it responsive. In total, it took me about 16 hours (with a bulk of that time going to lack of Vue familiarity)
